This code demonstrates the behavior of global variables in a C extension and
also the a scheme for handling and dispatching a TCL command in a general way.

There is the obligatory

   static int <lib-name>_Init(Tcl_Interp *interp)

function and the

   static int my_command_handler(
         ClientData cdata,
         Tcl_Interp *interp,
         int objc,
         Tcl_Obj *const objv[]
   )

which is provided to Tcl as it's interface to call my stuff.

This scheme uses the subcommand format since it is easier to add functions this
way.  Instead of doing a bunch of of Tcl_CreateObjCommand() for a bunch of
functions, we just treat the first argument as a mandatory subcommand.

A switch function looks up the subcommand in a table and dispatches to the right
fucntion.

The error codes are separated into implementation error codes and interface
error codes (GSTR_{SUCCESS,ERROR} and TCL_{OK,ERROR} respectively).
