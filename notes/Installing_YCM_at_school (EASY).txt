Installing YCM at school (EASY)

	1) Install Vundle (and download YCM)

			$ git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

		Add this at the top of your .vimrc file (notice the line with "Plugin 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe'")

			set nocompatible              " be iMproved, required
			filetype off                  " required

			" set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
			set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
			call vundle#begin()

			" let Vundle manage Vundle, required
			Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'

			" Extra plugins to add with vundle go here
			Plugin 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe'

			call vundle#end()            " required
			filetype plugin indent on    " required

		Launch vim and run

			PluginInstall

		in command mode (so from normal mode, hit ":" then type the command and hit ENTER).  This will take some time since it will run git clone of the YouCompleteMe github repository.

	2) Compile YouCompleteMe:
		
		(You can lookup what extra flags you might want.  --clang-completer is for C family of languages).

			$ cd .vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/
			$ ./install.py --clang-completer

	3) Add a .ycm_extra_conf.py to your C/C++ project directory to enable completion.  

		Most of the time the one given by Valloric:

			$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Valloric/ycmd/master/cpp/ycm/.ycm_extra_conf.py

		will do.

	APPENDIX

		A) Confirm extra_conf

			By default, you will be asked whether or not to load the .ycm_extra_conf.py every time you load vim.  To disable add

				let g:ycm_confirm_extra_conf = 0

			to vimrc file.

		B) Global extra_conf

			Define a path to a .ycm_extra_conf.py file to load if a project specific one is not found in your project directory.

                let g:ycm_global_ycm_extra_conf = ''
                                                  /\
                                            Path goes here
		C) NOTES:

			At home, I needed to do

				$ dnf install clang cmake python-devel

			Add these to my fedoraInstall/startupBasic.sh
