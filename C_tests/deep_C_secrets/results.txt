page 142 number 1: overall size of output is 8378
page 142 number 2: new size is 8415
page 142 number 3: new size is 12447 (Note that when initializing the array with
   the value 0, the size stays the same.  This is because the compiler still
   puts the array in BSS because it knows that at runtime the space allocated
   for things from BSS will be zero-initialized.)
